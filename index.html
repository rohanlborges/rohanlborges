          <p>I am a rising Junior at <a href="https://newhouse.syracuse.edu/"> Syracuse University<a> majoring in Magazine and Digital Journalism at the <strong>Newhouse School</strong> of Communications. As an aspiring sports journalist, I constantly seek opportunities to enhance my writing and build on my experience as a blog contributor and digital content creator.</p>
          <p>Recently, I've been focused on fulfilling my major requirements ahead of my Spring semester abroad in LA. As a part of the Newhosue curriculum I'll benefit from hands-on experience in both an internship and classroom setting.<p/>
