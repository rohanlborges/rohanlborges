			<p>On a warm afternoon in 2020, Rhonda Vesey took a familiar stroll through Syracuse's Southside, hoping the activity might lift her from the grip of a depression that had settled over her since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Passing Valley Plaza, a central hub in her community, she was struck by a disheartening realization: the neighborhood had been without a grocery store since 2018. In its place stood a Dollar General, with aisles of canned goods and processed foods but nothing fresh to nourish the nearby families.

"What in the heck are people doing to buy fresh food?" Vesey wondered, frustration sparking an idea that would help transform her life and her community.
The answer, she decided, was action. 

Rallying neighbors, she co-founded Food Access for Healthy Neighborhoods Now (FAHNN). She launched Valley Plaza's first farmers' market—an initiative driven by the urgent need for fresh food in one of Syracuse's largest food deserts.</p>

			<h3>Historical Context</h3>
			<p>The scarcity of grocery stores is not a new issue but rather the result of decades of economic changes. During the mid-20th century, waves of suburbanization led to residents and businesses leaving the city for the suburbs, where more profitable stores soon followed. As manufacturing jobs left, poverty rates spiked in many inner-city neighborhoods, including the Southside.
"Food deserts have cropped up in those areas because large retail grocery stores don't see it as a profitable thing to open in certain neighborhoods," Vesey noted. "That leaves residents with limited options of only corner stores or convenience stores to go and grocery shop."</p>

			<p>The map illustrates a stark contrast in grocery store distribution between Syracuse's North and South sides. The Southside, where Vesey resides, is notably underserved, with residents lacking convenient access to full-service grocery stores. This disparity underscores the challenges faced by communities like hers, where obtaining fresh produce is a daily struggle.

			<h3>A Persistent Poverty Line</h3>
			<p>Despite various economic initiatives, the poverty rate in New York State has hovered around 14% over the past two decades. This persistent statistic reflects systemic issues that contribute to food insecurity, particularly in urban areas like Syracuse's Southside.</p>
		</section>

			<h3>The Impact of Food Deserts</h3>
			<p>In communities like the Southside, where food insecurity is woven into daily life, the lack of accessible grocery stores adds a layer of struggle that residents navigate daily. Vesey's story sheds light on a larger crisis in Onondaga County, where food insecurity and a scarcity of fresh produce have compounded the challenges facing its most vulnerable residents.

"The lack of transportation alone is one of the biggest problems for impoverished families," Vesey explained. "Even the thought of having a central city bus line is not helpful because if you have a family of young children and you need to go grocery shopping from where we are, it's [an initial] ride to the transportation hub and then another ride to whatever store you need to get to."

This transportation gap exacerbates a food landscape already marked by limited options. With corner stores and fast-food chains often being the only available food sources, residents struggle to access fresh produce or affordable grocery items. According to the U.S. Census, around 50% of Syracuse's children live in poverty, and nearly one-third of households lack a vehicle.</p>

			<h3>Looking Forward</h3>
			<p>Though policy changes may be slow, Vesey and others like her offer a glimmer of hope. Their efforts are not just about filling the gaps left by a lack of grocery stores; they represent a blueprint for community-led solutions to food insecurity. In Onondaga County and nationwide, initiatives like these are emerging as testaments to the strength of communities working together to overcome systemic challenges.
"I live it, I breathe it, I sleep it," Vesey said. "It's not my job. I'm not being paid. But I have worked over 40 hours a week for two years now, helping to make a difference in the valley Southside community and the city of Syracuse."
Vesey's unwavering dedication inspires, demonstrating that even in the face of systemic challenges, individual and collective action can pave the way for meaningful change.
